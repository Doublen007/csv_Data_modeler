# csv_Data_modeler
A Python function designed to easily model data from a csv or excel file. Currently I've been using it mainly graph data from mad star Mesa stellar evolution code, (http://user.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=ez-web), but it works with any data that can be represented as a dataframe using pandas..
